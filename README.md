This JavaScript project implements a simple, browser-based horoscope generator that determines a user's zodiac sign and displays a corresponding daily reading. The application defines a JavaScript object (horoscopes) containing predetermined text for each of the twelve signs. It utilizes a getZodiacSign function with conditional logic to calculate the correct sign based on a provided month and day. An event listener attached to a "yell" (submit) button captures the user's birthday input, parses the date using the Date object, calculates the appropriate sign, and dynamically updates the textContent of a designated DOM element to display the personalized horoscope reading.
